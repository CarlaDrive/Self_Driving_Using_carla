##This Specialization gives you a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art engineering practices used in the self-driving car industry. You'll get to interact with real data sets from an autonomous vehicle (AV)â€•all through hands-on projects using the open source simulator CARLA.

##2. Learn Objects
1) Understand the detailed architecture and components of a self-driving car software stack
2) Implement methods for static and dynamic object detection, localization and mapping, behaviour and maneuver planning, and vehicle control
3) Use realistic vehicle physics, complete sensor suite: camera, LIDAR, GPS/INS, wheel odometry, depth map, semantic segmentation, object bounding boxes
4) Demonstrate skills in CARLA and build programs with Python
